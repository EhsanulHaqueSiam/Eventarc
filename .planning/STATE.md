# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-11)

**Core value:** QR-based event operations (entry + food) must be accurate at scale -- no false positives, no false negatives, no race conditions, even with 10K concurrent scans.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Foundation & Domain Model

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 10 (Foundation & Domain Model)
Plan: 0 of 3 in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-04-11 -- Roadmap created with 10 phases covering 58 requirements

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Go backend chosen over Rust (I/O-bound workload, research HIGH confidence)
- [Roadmap]: Scan processing split into two phases (core + food rules) to isolate highest-risk work
- [Roadmap]: Offline resilience separated from vendor scanning for independent delivery and testing

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- QR HMAC payload format must be locked in Phase 3 before any cards are generated -- changing it after invitation delivery is impossible
- libvips vs Go stdlib for image compositing needs benchmark resolution before Phase 8
- Bangladesh SMS carrier rate limits need provider-specific research before Phase 8
